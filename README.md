<p style="font-size: 20px;">Who could have assumed that a boy from Brooklyn, his father a garment worker from what is now Ukraine, and a mother from New York state, would have grew into one of the most prolific and important science advocates of the 20th Century?
  The young boy quickly dove into science, crediting his love for exploration to the
  
  <a class="yellow-text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1939_New_York_World%27s_Fair">1939 World Fair</a>.Carl flew through highschool with straight A's, applying to the University of Chicago at age 16, one of the few colleges which allowed younger people to be admitted. He grew and fostered his love for science and discovery, going on to be part of a team to first hypothesize liquid compounds on Saturn's moon Titan and Jupiter's moon Europa.

<h1 style="color: yellow;"<em>Cosmos</em></h1>
<div class="text-left">
<p style="font-size: 20px;">Undoubtedly, Carl Sagan's most popular and important piece of work was the 13 episode Epic telivision series:<a class="yellow-text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmos:_A_Personal_Voyage"><em>Cosmos: A Personal Voyage</em></a>.Cosmos aired on September 28th, 1980, quickly becoming the most viewed telivision series in American history until 1990. Up until 2009, it was still the most viewed PBS documentary ever released, prying open the speculative eye of countless wondering children and many adults a-like. The series covered topics ranging from the nature and beginning of existence, to our special part in our beautiful universe. As a boy, watching Cosmos and listening to Carl explain the intricate magic of our own reality fostered a wonder in my own mind, giving me hope that someday I too might open someones eyes to the magesty of our own <em>cosmos</em>.</p>
